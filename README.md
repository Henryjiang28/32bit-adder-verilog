# 32bit-adder-In verilog
The purpose of this project is to minimize the processor size by reusing the same circuitry. At each clock cycle, a 32-bit processor is able to perform one 32-bit addition, two parallel 16-bit additions, or four parallel 8-bit additions. 

run.ys uses yosys to synthesize designs.
